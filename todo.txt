- meet in the middle (well just general concept)
- things to remember (general notes)
- BigInt lib (maybe not cuz gfg - config a lil)
- edit TRIEBITS and Dijkstra to be more general
- make my own sparse table
- add mCn without extra calc
- add STRING mod INT function might help
- Integral lib maybe (for nums under mod) (nero lib is good)
- add fenwick code
- add sieve
- add some geometry lib (with function to check if point inside rectangle cuz helpful)
- add 2D cumulative sum code (cuz it can get messy)
- grid things (dx, dy, etc)
- add DSU (cp4 UF is good)
- add bridges and articulation points finders
- add Treaps (blackbox)
- add josuphus recurrences (also indexed set solution)
- add decending the tree to the segtree code
- add MOs algo
- add sqrt decomposition
- add euler tour

* to learn:
    Second Min spanning tree (LCA solution)
    learn about Treaps
    learn about red-black trees, splay trees, interval trees, quad trees (general knowledge)
